Repurposed an old Windows netbook with a dead keyboard by installing a lightweight Linux OS, now it's hidden out of sight streaming Spotify to a vintage amp via a decent DAC. Excellent sound quality for minimal expenditure. SpotCommander works perfectly, with a load of features. I like how I can even turn the PC off directly from the app.*  \r\n\\- Nicole\r\n\r\n*Awesome. Worked off the shelf with Ubuntu 14.04 without any problems or configuration.*  \r\n\\- Brandon\r\n\r\n*Just works. Thanks! Now I have my own cheap Sonos.*  \r\n\\- Tim\r\n\r\n*Seriously awesome. Better than any of the Windows remotes*  \r\n\\- Alex\r\n\r\n*Best spotify controller for linux. I tried several other controllers but none had such a straightforward and feature packed interface. Very happy. Thanks*  \r\n\\- Richard\r\n\r\n*Very impressed. Great design, just works, no technical setup needed, this is what Linux needs!*  \r\n\\- Andy\r\n\r\n*Best Spotify remote by far. Works very well, beautiful and functional. Full control, artwork and integration.*  \r\n\\- Dan\r\n\r\n*Wow!!!\tThis app does everything I need it to and more! It is absolutely incredible!
