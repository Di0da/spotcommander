HOW TO UPGRADE:

http://www.olejon.net/code/spotcommander/?upgrade

BEFORE UPGRADING:

* Close SpotCommander completely on all your devices before upgrading
* You have to reauthorize with Spotify for Profile in the side menu to work (Top Tracks)

CHANGELOG v 12.7:

* Partially support for Spotify v 1.0. The new MPRIS behaviour breaks some features, like playing playlists, artists and local files. A workaround is to queue all tracks from the overflow menu. It is still recommended to use Spotify v 0.9.17.8 (http://www.olejon.net/code/spotcommander/?downgrade_spotify)
* If running Spotify v 1.0, you can now Play and Shuffle Play albums
* Discover new music with Recommendations! Tap on a track > Three dots > Recommendations and get a list of recommended tracks
* In Library, albums are now synchronized with your saved albums in Spotify
* Top Tracks in Profile
* Fixed Toggle Shuffle and Repeat on newer distributions
* Bug fixes and minor changes
