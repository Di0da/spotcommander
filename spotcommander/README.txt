HOW TO UPGRADE:

http://www.olejon.net/code/spotcommander/?upgrade

BEFORE UPGRADING:

* Close SpotCommander completely on all your devices before upgrading
* Android users: Make sure you are running v 4.6 or newer of the Android app. For some reason Google suspended the donate version of the Android app. If you have it installed, uninstall it and install the free version instead. Sorry for the inconvenience!
* You must reauthorize with Spotify for some of the new features to work. Go to Profile in the menu and tap the top right icon to deauthorize. When it is done, tap the top right icon to authorize again

CHANGELOG v 12.3:

* New features in Spotify's web API (you must reauthorize with Spotify first)
* Search results now include playlists, at the bottom
* When you add a playlist to your playlists, you will follow it and it will appear in Spotify as well as SpotCommander (you must reauthorize with Spotify first)
* You can now delete playlists. This means that when you choose to delete a playlist in SpotCommander, it will also be deleted in Spotify. This way, your list of playlists in Spotify and SpotCommander will stay the same. If the playlist is not yours, you will simply unfollow it (you must reauthorize with Spotify first)
* Follow and unfollow artists and users. No more than this is available in the API as of now (you must reauthorize with Spotify first)
* To add an artist to your library, you must now follow the artist, which will add the artist to your saved artists in Spotify as well (you must reauthorize with Spotify first)
* Minor changes and bug fixes

CHANGELOG v 12.2:

* When using the Android app, the action bar now changes color as well depending on the colors of the cover art
* Fixed suspending and shutting down after queued tracks not working on some systems
* When in widescreen mode, show more controls on the bottom action bar

CHANGELOG v 12.1:

* Fixed a bug where SpotCommander would not work on some older distributions (https://github.com/olejon/spotcommander/issues/69)

CHANGELOG v 12.0:

* New design inspired by Material Design
* Icons for extra high resolution displays
* View other users' profile and playlists
* Search for users by username
* Save users to Library
* View number of followers in Profile
* View how many followers an artist has
* Queue in main menu
* Links to Last.fm and Wikipedia in artist biographies
* Colored status bar on iOS
* Fixed bug where no more than 50 playlists would be imported
* Fixed bug where library import would fail with more than 500 tracks
* Fixed time zone bug in Browse
* Suspend and shut down computer should now work on all systems
* Various changes and bug fixes
