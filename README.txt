 * If you are upgrading from v 8.8 or older, make sure you reload/refresh the web app at least twice on every device
 * If stuck, you should clear the application cache: http://www.olejon.net/code/spotcommander/?clear_application_cache
 * If you install using the deb package, a repository will now be added so SpotCommander will be updated with the rest of the system

CHANGELOG:

 * Remember scroll position
 * Edit playlist names
 * Discover renamed to Browse to better match Spotify
 * Featured playlists in Browse
 * News in Browse
 * Choose to pause, stop, suspend or shut down after currently playing track and queued tracks
 * View local files in playlists
 * View recently played playlists
 * Position mouse cursor when playing track radio automatically
 * Pause on outgoing call setting (Android app)
 * Shake to skip is now only available in the Android app (more reliable)

 KNOWN ISSUES:

  * When opening the app from the home screen in landscape mode on an iPad running iOS 8, the app moves up under the status bar. This is a bug in iOS 8. Open the app in portrait mode instead. It can then be rotated to landscape mode.
